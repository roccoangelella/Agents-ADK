Given the extreme constraints of 'potatoes only, no fire, no dressing, no tools,' the concept of a 'recipe' is nearly impossible. These are simply ways to consume a raw potato:

1.  **The Whole Raw Potato:** Pick a potato and eat it directly, unpeeled and uncooked, using only your teeth to break it down.
2.  **The Chewed Raw Potato:** Focus on thoroughly chewing small portions of a raw potato to aid in digestion.
3.  **The Washed Raw Potato:** If access to water is permitted (assuming it's not a 'tool'), rinse the potato before consuming it raw.
4.  **The Small Raw Potato:** Select a particularly small, easily manageable potato and eat it raw in its entirety.
5.  **The Masticated Raw Potato:** A formal way to describe the act of breaking down a raw potato with your teeth and mouth, focusing on the mechanical process of eating it in its raw, natural state.
